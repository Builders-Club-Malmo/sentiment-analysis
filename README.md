## Introduction

This project will guide you through creating and evaluating a **sentiment classifier** that labels text (e.g., movie reviews or user comments) as **positive** or **negative**. The main goal is to train and evaluate your own sentiment analysis model.

While a basic approach is provided, you‚Äôre encouraged to explore other tools, languages, or methodologies to achieve the same goal.

You can:
- Work **individually** or in **small teams**.
- Follow the **beginner-friendly** path or explore **advanced topics** if you‚Äôre more experienced.
- Present your **findings and solutions** in the Builders Club final meeting.

---

## Project Goals

1. **Train a Sentiment Classifier**  
   Build a sentiment analysis model that predicts whether a given text is positive or negative.

2. **Evaluate the Model**  
   Assess your model's performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Flexible Implementation**  
   Use the provided boilerplate as a starting point, or choose your own tools, frameworks, or languages to achieve the same outcome.

4. **Collaboration and Reflection**  
   Encourage discussions on **challenges**, **interesting insights**, and **solutions** during the final presentation.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (or a version compatible with the libraries in `requirements.txt`).
- Basic familiarity with:
  - Running Python scripts from the command line.
  - Git (optional but recommended).
- (Optional) Some knowledge of machine learning concepts‚Äîespecially helpful for advanced tasks.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/sentiment-analysis-group-project.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-group-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Or use `conda install --file requirements.txt` if you prefer conda.)*

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Place your dataset (e.g., `imdb_sample.csv`) in the `data/` folder, or use any existing example.
   - Ensure your CSV has columns like `review` (text) and `sentiment` (binary label).

4. **Run the Basic Training Script** (Optional Starting Point)
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Split into train/test sets.
   - Train a baseline classifier (Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes).
   - Display accuracy or F1 score.
   - Save the model (e.g., `model.joblib`).

5. **Predict Sentiment** (Optional Starting Point)
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py "I loved this movie so much!"
   ```
   This script:
   - Loads the saved model.
   - Transforms the input text.
   - Outputs ‚ÄúPositive sentiment‚Äù or ‚ÄúNegative sentiment.‚Äù

Feel free to use alternative methods to achieve the same functionality.

## Project Outline

1. **Project Setup (1‚Äì2 hours)**
   - Install dependencies.
   - Familiarize yourself with the file structure and code.

2. **Build a Sentiment Classifier (2‚Äì3 hours)**
   - Train a model using logistic regression, naive Bayes, or any other method.
   - Evaluate the model using test data.

3. **Evaluate and Reflect (1‚Äì2 hours)**
   - Note accuracy, potential issues (e.g., overfitting).
   - Compare metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Experiment (3‚Äì5 hours, optional)**
   - Try advanced approaches (e.g., fine-tuning a BERT model, custom preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning).

5. **Prepare Your Presentation (1‚Äì2 hours)**
   - Summarize your approach, findings, and next steps for the final meeting.


## üìä Data Sources
Participants can use any dataset of their choice. Here are some recommended sources:

- **IMDb Movie Reviews** ‚Äì [Stanford Sentiment Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- **Twitter US Airline Sentiment** ‚Äì [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/twitter-airline-sentiment)
- **Yelp Reviews** ‚Äì [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)


## Intermediate Challenges

For those wanting to explore beyond the basics:

1. **Fine-Tune a Pretrained Model**  
   - Use a [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) model (like BERT) to boost accuracy.
2. **Advanced Preprocessing**  
   - Implement custom tokenization, lemmatization, or part-of-speech tagging.
3. **Explainable AI**  
   - Use libraries like [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) or [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) to show why the model predicts certain outcomes.
4. **Frontend Integration**  
   - Build a simple user interface for interacting with your model, such as a form to submit text and view sentiment predictions.
5. **Visualization of Sentiment Predictions**  
   - Create visual representations of model predictions, such as bar charts for positive/negative distribution or word clouds for most frequent words.  
   - Highlight sentiment scores or key phrases influencing predictions using interactive tools like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
6. **Interactive Word Highlighting**  
   - Develop a feature that highlights positive and negative words in input text to give users insight into the model's decision-making process.
7. **Responsive Design for Mobile**  
   - Ensure that your frontend tool is mobile-friendly and provides the same functionality across devices.
